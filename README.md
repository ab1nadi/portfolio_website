# Portfolio Website
A new version of my portfolio website, rewritten in Typescript. It uses Shadcn components for a sleeker look, and leverages strapi as a backend so I can dynamically update content on the frontend. 
The website is hosted on Github pages: https://ab1nadi.github.io/portfolio_website/

## Features
* **Responsive Design:** The website is optimized to work across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.
* **Typescript:** Written with typescript for easy maintainability and code readability.
* **Shadcn:** Uses Shadcn for a beautiful design and sleek look.
* **React.js:** The website is built using React.js; this results in cleaner code and better performance.
*  **Tailwind CSS:** The styling of the website is implemented with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of pre-built components and utility classes.
*  **Dynamic Content:** The website allows me to easily add and update content, such as projects, certifications, and skills, by modifying content on my hosted strapi server.
