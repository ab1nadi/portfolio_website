# Portfolio Website
A new version of my portfolio website that leverages strapi as a backend so I can dynamically update content on the frontend.

## Features
* **Responsive Design:** The website is optimized to work across different devices and screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience.
* **React.js:** The website is built using React.js; this results in cleaner code and better performance.
*  **Tailwind CSS:** The styling of the website is implemented with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that provides a comprehensive set of pre-built components and utility classes.
*  **Dynamic Content:** The website allows me to easily add and update content, such as projects, certifications, and skills, by modifying content on my hosted strapi server.

## Getting Started
